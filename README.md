# Pose Estimation using APIs

This project demonstrates how to perform pose estimation using an API. It sends an image to a remote server, receives pose estimation results, and visualizes the estimated pose on the image.

## Introduction

In this project, we provide a Python script that takes an input image, sends it to a specified API server, and receives pose estimation results. The code then visualizes the estimated pose on the image by drawing key points and connecting lines between them.

Pose estimation can be useful for various applications, including motion analysis, human-computer interaction, and virtual reality, by utilizing an external pose estimation service via an API.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this code, make sure you have the following:

1. **Python**: You need to have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Python Libraries**: You will need the following Python libraries, which you can install using pip:

   - `requests`: To make HTTP requests.
   - `matplotlib`: For visualization.
   - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
   - `os`: For handling file operations.
   - `cv2` (OpenCV): For image processing.

   You can install these libraries using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install requests matplotlib numpy opencv-python-headless
   ```

3. **Input Image**: You should have an input image for pose estimation. Replace `"path of image"` in the code with the actual path to your image.

4. **API Server**: This code assumes that there is an API server running at a specified URL (`http://localhost:9900/v1/estimatepose`). Make sure the server is set up and running.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/post-estimation-using-apis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd post-estimation-using-apis
   ```

3. Open the Python script (`pose_estimation.py`) and replace the following placeholders:

   - `"path of image"` with the actual path to your input image.
   - `"http://localhost:9900/v1/estimatepose"` with the actual URL of the API server if different.

## Code Explanation

Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. Load the input image using OpenCV.

2. Convert the image to a base64 string for sending it as binary data in the API request.

3. Send a POST request to the API server with the image data.

4. If the API response is successful (HTTP status code 200), parse the response JSON and extract pose estimation information, specifically the key points.

5. Visualize the estimated pose on the image using Matplotlib by plotting key points and connecting lines.

6. Display the image with the visualized pose.

## Usage

To run the code, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python pose_estimation.py
```

This will send the input image to the API server, receive pose estimation results, and display the image with the visualized pose.

Feel free to customize the code and adapt it to your specific use case and API endpoints.

## Example

Here's how you can run the code with a sample image:

```bash
python pose_estimation.py
```

This will demonstrate the pose estimation process using the provided sample code.
